## What is it

It's for me to practise coding. I started to write code to that game from a very first lesson of Swift.
I would like to this game would grow with me as I learn to code. We will see where it lead us :)

- [x] used MVVM software architecture 
- [x] followed coding best practices and SOLID principles
- [x] used Gitflow
- [x] all critical parts of application covered by unit tests with use of Bitrise CI

## How to use it

Follow your colour! 
You have 60 seconds. 
Pick your favorite color and remember it. 
After colors change tap your choosen color to get a point.
If your choosen color is not on the screen, swipe down or shake your phone to shuffle.
If you choose wrong color you lose a point.
Simple as that!
Ho!

## What new I've learned

- Settings.bundle
- MVC design pattern
- MVVM design pattern
- Try to be SOLID
- Timer class
- UISwipeGestureRecognizer for swipe down and shake
- Observed properties
- Giflow
- Danger with SwiftLint

## To-do

- [x] Add logic to shuffle colors and remember user's choice
- [x] Use Travis CI
- [x] Use MVVM design pattern
- [x] Add Game Over screen with user score
- [x] Make welcome screen with start game and difficulty levels
- [ ] Allow user to set his name and persist his data
- [ ] Add pause game functionality
- [ ] Connect with Apple Game Center
- [x] Add difficulty levels (more/less colors to choose from, different range of colors error)
- [ ] Change default sounds of xylophone to something better
- [ ] Tailor UI and UX
- [x] Unit Tests
