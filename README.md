## What is it

It's for me to practise coding. I started to write code to that game from a very first lesson of Swift.
I would like to this game would grow with me as I learn to code. We will see where it lead us :)

- [x] used MVVM software architecture 
- [x] followed coding best practices and SOLID principles
- [x] used Gitflow
- [x] all critical parts of application covered by unit tests with use of Travis CI

## How to use it

Follow your colour! 
You have 180 seconds. 
Pick your favorite color and remember it. 
After colors change tap your choosen color to get a point.
If your choosen color is not on the screen, swipe down to shuffle colors.
If you choose wrong color you lose a point.
Simple as that!
Ho!
