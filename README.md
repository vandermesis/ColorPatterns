## What for

It's for me to practise coding. I started to write code to that game from a very first lesson of Swift.
I would like to this game would grow with me as I learn to code. We will see where it lead us :)

## How to use it

Follow your colour! 

You have 60 seconds. 

Pick your favorite color and remember it. 

After colors change tap your choosen color to get a point.

If your choosen color is not on the screen, swipe down or shake your phone to shuffle.

If you choose wrong color you lose a point.

Simple as that!
Ho!

## What new I've learned

- Settings.bundle
- MVC design pattern
- Try to be SOLID
- Timer class
- UISwipeGestureRecognizer for swipe down and shake
- Observed properties

## To-do

- [x] Add logic to shuffle colors and remember user's choice
- [x] Conform to MVC, move game logic to separate structs in Model
- [ ] Make welcome screen with start and options
- [ ] Allow user to set his name and persist his data
- [ ] Connect with Apple Game Center
- [ ] Add difficulty levels (more/less colors to choose from, different range of colors error)
- [ ] Change default sounds of xylophone to something better

- [ ] Tailor UI and UX
- [ ] Unit Tests

## Setup

- Xcode 10.3 with iOS SDK (12.2)
